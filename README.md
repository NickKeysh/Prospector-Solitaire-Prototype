# Prospector-Solitaire-Prototype
The Prospector Solitaire Prototype was created from the book "Unity and C#. Gamedev from idea to implementation" [Jeremy Gibson].
This prototype covers the following topics: using XML configuration files, designing for mobile devices, working with 2D sprites.
In this card game, the player needs to discard all the cards in the deck. A card can be discarded if its level is one level higher or lower than a card in the deck. If there is no discard card, the player may change the card in the deck.
